In patient care, knowledge of a person's past or present job(s) can impact recognition, diagnosis, management, and treatment of injuries and illnesses. These data also can be used for clinical decision support and to prompt discussion of preventive care measures. For example, a record of jobs that require prolonged time in the sun might prompt a health care provider to inquire if the person wears protective clothing or sunscreen while working.\nAt a minimum, it is important to have a record of a person's current job(s); i.e., the job(s) in which a person is engaged at the time that he or she presents to a health care provider, regardless of duration, and to retain that information over time.
