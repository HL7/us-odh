# APPROVED by HL7 Cross Group Projects WG May 27, 2021: Profiles do not derive from one of the base US profiles because they do not align with any of the US Core Observations

# Extensions - all extensions have examples inside the main profiles   


# These are profiles defined in this IG


# The value sets and code systems are  from PHINVADS


# The slice is defined by value sets from PHINVADS. Since the validator is not able to access those values, it is not able to distinguish the slices even though they are correctly instantiated.


# These profiles are externally defined
